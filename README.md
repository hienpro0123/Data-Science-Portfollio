# 👋 About me
Hi, I’m Trinh Quang Hien — a Data Science intern and third-year student at the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City (IUH). I enjoy building end-to-end data pipelines and clear dashboards using Python, SQL, Power BI, Airflow, and Docker. My goal is to turn raw data into actionable insights for real business decisions.
